 * Created by lukas on 08.04.14.
 *
 * This activity represents the genrall settings for the alarm Clock that are not specific to any action
 *
 * These should be as vew as possible, mostly just some log in data for web servces such as
 * Dropbox or last.fm... And even those I am not that sure about.
 *
 * Mainly I kind wish, there was no settings.
