# FAQ
**What the Hell? There are like a billion alarm clock apps out there?**

Yes, but I don't know of any clock that does all the stuff this one does. I have a hard time getting up so I want loud music, bright lights 
and my coffee to be ready. It is basically designed around my needs and I just put it here in case anybody wants to have this stuff too. You can just download the apk for free or get the code right here and make it even better.

**Will there be more features**

Yes. Whenever I make the app better to m ake sure I get up better I get used to the new feature after one or two weeks and I need to make the clock even better, even more tricky, even more effective. So, new features will come.
