Features:
#### Alarm Clock
* Alarm Clock that wakes you up with music of your choice
* You can chose what songs you want to wake up to by selecting a folder on your device with music (or use dropbox). The Alarm clock will select one at random.
* You can have the song fade in slowly or start loud
* Define your own snooze time or if you even want a snooze button shown

#### Website on wake up
* Define a web site to be shown on alert (for example a news web site)

#### Countdown on wake up
* You don't have all the time in the world. You need to get the bus? You always wan't to know how much time is left until you need to get out? Activate the Countdown, which will start with the first alarm and tell you when you have to got. The alarm-clock will stop the alert when it has run out, so you don't even have to be there any more.

#### Reminder to go to bed
* Get a reminder to go to bed several hours before the alarm rings (you can define how many hours)
* Get the reminder send to you via email

#### Radio Player
* Listen to the radio after the alarm has rung. You have the choice between several radio stations

#### DropBox Integration

#### Philips Hue Integration
* Turn on the lights when its time to wake up with the Philips Hue that can be connected with almost no effort

## FAQ
**What the Hell? There are like a billion alarm clock apps out there!**

Yes, but I don't know of any clock that does all the stuff this one does. I have a hard time getting up so I want loud music, bright lights 
and my coffee to be ready. It is basically designed around my needs and I just put it here in case anybody wants to have this stuff too. 
You can just download the APK or get the code right here and make it even better.

**Will there be more features?**

Yes. Whenever I make the app better to make sure I get up better I get used to the new feature after one or two weeks and I need to make the clock even better, even more tricky, even more effective. So, new features will come.
